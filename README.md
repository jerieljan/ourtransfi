# OurTransfi

The home page of the Transfiguration of Christ Parish.
http://www.ourtransfi.org

The Home Project is intended to be a fully-static web project with no
serviceable web service components, intended for cheap static hosting and
content that doesn't need dynamic updates.

The repository for the Wordpress setup is also in git, but not in GitHub.

## Libraries Used

- jQuery
- Twitter Bootstrap: Common web framework for layouts and common web elements
- AngularJS

## Deployment

Use the sync.sh script to deploy the application. You'll need the right key configuration to do this.
