When you gaze into the eyes of the Crucified Lord, and he gazes into yours, you encounter the love of the Resurrected Lord.  Many prefer not to look. Many
recoil at looking into the eyes of a man in deadly pain. Many balk at having to respond to love. But these are not the
eyes of a defeated man, condemned for criminal insurrection. They are the eyes of an unlikely King, who in dealing death its death blow, still looks into our eyes with
challenge.

In his love is his call to the Kingdom of his Father, his Kingdom of justice, compassion, peace and life to the full.

In the sign of this crucified Lord, now resurrected, we your Pastors, invite you to the celebration of the Year of the Poor.  Behold Jesus, poor. No
image of Jesus, poor, surpasses this one. Jesus hangs from his Cross stripped of his clothes, his dignity, his possessions, his
power, his strength. He is fully one with the unwashed, the oppressed, the scorned, the powerless, the miserable, the outcaste. In the Year of the Poor, look into the eyes of
the crucified Lord. There is no experience richer.

## You who are poor... 
        
In those eyes, you who are poor, feel his suffering-with-you. From his Cross, he walks with
you through crowded alleys, stumbles on mud, recoils at the stench of unmoved sewerage.
He bows to enter your makeshift home hobbled together from salvaged materials; it is for your family, but you share it perforce with rats and cockroaches, an oven in the hot
season, a waterfall when rainy.

On his Cross, he is with you - God with you.  He has taken on your nakedness, your
vulnerability, your hunger, your illness, your shame. You once thought you could escape the
hardship of your rural beginnings. But your suffering only increased. Here, you cannot find
the *camote* to chase the hunger from your belly; you cannot find the herbs to stop your baby's
vomiting and diarrhea; you cannot find money even to keep your single bulb burning. Here, though amidst thousands, neighbors are distant.

You were once grateful for the backbreaking work you finally found; your work continues to
break your back, and bend you. But your debts just continue to grow. The clothes and shoes
you bought last year to send your children to school are already worn out. In your home you
have an altar. Mary is there. *The Nazareno* is there. So is the *Sto. Niño*. You pray. But you
tremble when you hear the shouts of the demolition crews approaching. You cry out for
mercy. You look into the eyes of your crucified King.

Looking into his eyes, you feel his gaze into your soul. You do not understand. Why the love
for you, but a poor man? Why the energy from the Cross to convince you: you are loved?
Why the persisting message like a mantra in the sign of the Cross: "I have come to bring life,
and bring life to the full," and, "Blessed are you who are poor.... Blessed are you who 
hunger now... Blessed are you when men hate you..."

Why his silent acceptance of abuse, hatred, rejection, oppression and death in rejection
of yours? Why his abiding identification with you, as he calls on his disciples to act in
your aid? *"Whatever you do for this poor person, that you do for me. ... Whatever you do not do for this
poor person, that you do not do for me?"* Why, on your behalf, to any who follow him, his
mandate to works of mercy? "Feed the hungry. Give drink to the thirsty. Clothe the naked.
Shelter the homeless. Visit the sick. Ransom the captive. Bury the dead."  For the answers
to these questions... look into his eyes, and search within.
     
## You who are weary...

In the Year of the Poor, all you who labor and are heavily burdened, we your Pastors invite
you, as Jesus himself did: come to Jesus. *"Come to me,"* Jesus said, *"and I will give you
rest.”* Life has not reduced you to penury, but life has not lifted you to wealth. To you also
Jesus has said, *"I have come to give life, and to give it to the full."*

Thinking of your families, your spouses, your children, the relatives who run to you for help
in their unending need, you work long hours, you work overtime, you even take on second
and third jobs, just to make ends meet. Often ends don't meet; demands exhaust you; your
taskmasters overstress you; worries distress you.

But you labor on in love. Thinking of the smiles on your children's faces and the promises
you have made your spouse to provide adequately, you work on, hoping your sacrifice will
bring the full life that Jesus brings. Whenever you can, whenever you remember, you pray.
You ask him to help. You ask his mother for help. He does help. She does come to your aid.
You know that. Now, coming to Jesus hanging from his Cross, look into his eyes as he looks
into yours with love.

## You who are rich...

“I have come to bring life,” he said, “life to the full.” Some of you, sadly, are unmoved by
this. You do not believe this. You do not believe Jesus brings anything. You say you do, but you don't.

For you, the fullness of life is the good life: your doing. It is not gifted, but taken. It is not
brought to you as a blessing from above, but seized as a result of pushing and shoving from
below. It is not selfless, but selfish. It is fueled by pride, scheming ambition, the exhilaration
of power, the taste of blood. For this you work harder than hard, you push yourselves to
the limit, you even push beyond the limit. To achieve “the sweet life,” to outdo your
ambitions, to over satiate your sycophants, to make them applaud without end, you abuse your
bodies, you break the law, you violate your conscience; you ravage Creation. Your social life is
your needy ego. You manipulate people, exploit their skills; take advantage of their
weaknesses; pay them poorly. What is rightly theirs, you steal; what rightly belongs to society, you
conceal. What is there for all, you hoard for yourself. For you, there is no common good, only your good!

You build your first house, then your second houses; you provide for your family, then for
your second families. You fill your lives with deceit, hypocrisy, and misery, and so glory in
your "good life.” You take great satisfaction in that you are not like the rest of the rabble.
You have no need for prayer; you have no need for God.

In this Year of the Poor, we your Pastors invite you, step back from the rat race, the
pressure, the din. Step back, and look into the eyes of the King.

His gaze penetrates through your eyes to your heart. It is the same gaze of compassion as
his gaze into the eyes of the poor. But it is a gaze altered by your own arrogance and
cynicism. It is a gaze marked by concern. You may not wish to hear his message, but he says it
again for you: *"Woe to you who are rich, for you have received your consolation. Woe to you who
are full now, for you will be hungry. Woe to you who laugh now, for you will mourn and
weep. Woe when society speaks well of you, for your fathers did the same to false prophets."* 

He doesn't thunder this from loudspeakers, nor embarrass you with this in the media, for you
are well-respected and honorable persons. He says it simply in his gaze, knowing fully you
can reject it, as you have rejected it before.

But in the Year of the Poor, where so many poor are poor because of your decisions, he also
reminds you that over concern with your humungous investments, your corporate takeovers,
your capture of political power and your fine reputations to the detriment or negligence of the
poor may have serious consequences. *"Whatever you have done or not done to one of these
the least of my brothers and sisters, that you have done or not done to me."* For not feeding
the hungry, clothing the naked, succoring the sick, sheltering the stranger, visiting the
imprisoned, the Lord, the Just Judge, may say to you, *"Depart from me, you cursed, into the
eternal fire..." for I was poor, and you did not care.*

If you have trouble believing this, look into his eyes gazing at you from the Cross.

## Behold Jesus poor...

If that gaze, filled will love, brings you to confusion, shame and repentance in this Year of
the Poor, then consider its urgent challenge for you:

With God's grace, turn away from your haughtiness, your pride, your selfishness, your
idolatry of money, your all-consuming fascination with power. In love, work to build the
Kingdom of God on earth! 

In the Philippines, this means, urgently: stop the corruption. 

Stop the misuse of the People's funds. Stop the wanton destruction of the environment.
Fight
the poverty of the poor. Build vibrant companies that use our resources to create wealth
for
our people, but distribute that wealth equitably.  Build an
economy that responds to the
unconscionable poverty of the fishermen, the tillers of the soil, the urban laborers.
Build an
economy that is open to the world, but whose benefits do not exclude the poor. Provide jobs.

Provide education that respects all our people as human beings and children of God, not
just
cogs in a global production machine. But provide education relevant to the fight against
dehumanizing poverty: basic education to all, and higher education to all who desire it.
            
Build a society of dialogue in our diversity, and especially for our poor, build a
society of
peace.  No more war, for the greatest victims of war are the
poor!

## Behold Jesus, hope of the poor...

If that gaze, filled with love, brings you in poverty to consolation, encouragement and
peace,
take heart in Jesus' love. He strengthens you, encourages you, and calls the Christian
community to help you progress from destitution to the fullness of life.

But help the community in helping yourselves. Should you have no work, look for work.
Should you have work, work well. Cultivate a personal sense of industry, self-respect
and
social responsibility. As the economy allows, continue to provide well for your family
in
love: nutritious food, adequate clothing, medical care, good education, wholesome
recreation.
Strive for conditions of work that are humane and just. Continue to contribute to the
welfare
of your neighbors, your barangay, your municipality, your city, your nation. Always be
helpful. Vote as the common good demands. Together with your spouse, lead your children
to the love and respect the Lord through our Catholic communion. Be active in your
parish
and in your basic ecclesiastical community. Love, as you are loved by God. Share
courageously of your faith in love! You are not just receivers of the Gospel. You are
its
bearers! 

## Shepherds looking into the eyes of the Good Shepherd...

Finally, in the year of the poor, we your pastors, and with us, all priests and
religious, look
with you into the eyes of the crucified Lord. How often it is that we have look into
those
tortured eyes and failed to notice their twinkle! We have seen only embarrassing defeat,
jaded suffering and obvious dying, but failed to notice the light that pierces the gloom
in our
hearts. 

In the void that loneliness and isolation brought by our distance from Crucified, we can
be
misled to fill the gaping abyss with new phones and ipads. We can cover the gaping
vacuum
with another luxury car or designer jeans or more fashionable shoes more than our shoe
racks
can contain; with a vacation out of the country or another gadget for the bedroom. We
can
hold on to the whisky bottle and hope that the bottled spirit will exorcise the spirit
of boredom
in us. It can also be filled up by working like a horse to impress the people, to create
a fans’
club and move you up higher to a better assignment. It can also increase our interest in
bank
savings, the stock market and the accumulation of more properties. Church funds and
personal
funds are deliberately mixed up. The parish crawls in financial difficulties while we
sprint and
jump with financial security. Our easy and comfortable lifestyles can make us numb to
the
peril of worldliness. It can make us at ease with ecclesiastical vanities.

How often have we reduced his living eyes to painted plastic on a wall, and deprived
ourselves of feeling what those eyes twinkling in passion convey: that we are noticed,
appreciated, valued, and sent forth. In so doing, we have cheated ourselves of the only
treasure in our calling: the felt certainty from the Cross that we are each individually
and
totally loved.

We have exchanged this prize, this pearl of great price  , for
the
compulsive conservation of
conceptual castles, for the anxious pettiness of rules and regulations, for the
obsessive
preservation of a pecking order, for the selfish defense of private space, for the
eccentric
collection of quaint things, as well as for the lifelong preparation for our retirement.
            

Or, we have exchanged this self-emptied Messiah for self-established messiahs on
distinguished thrones, ourselves rejecting the folly of the Cross, preferring the
authority of
feared prelates or the renown of pious celebrity or the fashionable cynicism of the
insecure.
For these recognized spiritual professionals, there is really no need for prayer, no
need for
prophets, and certainly no need for the unlettered and unwashed, for all ultimately is
about
themselves. 

## Look at Jesus...

In this year of the poor, we too are being asked in silence to peer into the eyes of the
crucified
Lord, not plastic, nor wooden, nor closed, but open for me, confusing me, disturbing me,
returning me to an original inspiration, healing me, raising me up, making me whole and
surprising me anew with unaccustomed joy. In those twinkling eyes, we consider the quiet
invitation to be actually poor, one with him, stripped of his clothes, his dignity, his
possessions, his power, his strength, one with the unwashed, the oppressed, the scorned,
the
powerless, the miserable, the outcaste. Of course, we can say *no*. We can repeat
the valid,
reasonable excuses. But we can also say *yes*.

In this Year of the Poor, may our neediness be turned to sanctity, and may our arrogance
be
turned to service.  In all, may the love of the Crucified Lord
triumph as he gazes into our
hearts and we dare to look into his.

Amen. Amen.
