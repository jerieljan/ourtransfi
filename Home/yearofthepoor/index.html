        <!-- Year of the Poor 2015-->

        <p>When you gaze into the eyes of the Crucified Lord, and he gazes into yours, you encounter
            the love of the Resurrected Lord. <a href="#ref-1">i</a> Many prefer not to look. Many
            recoil at looking into the
            eyes of a man in deadly pain. Many balk at having to respond to love. But these are not
            the
            eyes of a defeated man, condemned for criminal insurrection. They are the eyes of an
            unlikely King, who in dealing death its death blow, still looks into our eyes with
            challenge.
            In his love is his call to the Kingdom of his Father, his Kingdom of justice,
            compassion, peace
            and life to the full.</p>

        <p>In the <i>sign</i> of this crucified Lord, now resurrected, we your Pastors, invite you
            to the
            celebration of the Year of the Poor. <a href="#ref-2">ii</a> Behold Jesus, poor. No
            image
            of Jesus, poor, surpasses
            this one. Jesus hangs from his Cross stripped of his clothes, his dignity, his
            possessions, his
            power, his strength. He is fully one with the unwashed, the oppressed, the scorned, the
            powerless, the miserable, the outcaste. In the Year of the Poor, look into the eyes of
            the
            crucified Lord. There is no experience richer.</p>

        <h2>You who are poor...</h2>

        <p>In those eyes, you who are poor, feel his suffering-with-you. From his Cross, he walks
            with
            you through crowded alleys, stumbles on mud, recoils at the stench of unmoved sewerage.
            He bows to enter your makeshift home hobbled together from salvaged materials; it is for
            your family, but you share it perforce with rats and cockroaches, an oven in the hot
            season, a
            waterfall when rainy.</p>

        <p>On his Cross, he is with you - God with you. <a href="#ref-3">iii</a> He has taken on
            your
            nakedness, your
            vulnerability, your hunger, your illness, your shame. You once thought you could escape
            the
            hardship of your rural beginnings. But your suffering only increased. Here, you cannot
            find
            the <i>camote</i> to chase the hunger from your belly; you cannot find the herbs to stop
            your baby's
            vomiting and diarrhea; you cannot find money even to keep your single bulb burning.
            Here,
            though amidst thousands, neighbors <a href="#ref-4">iv</a> are distant.</p>

        <p>You were once grateful for the backbreaking work you finally found; your work continues
            to
            break your back, and bend you. But your debts just continue to grow. The clothes and
            shoes
            you bought last year to send your children to school are already worn out. In your home
            you
            have an altar. Mary is there. <i>The Nazareno</i> is there. So is the <i>Sto. Niño</i>.
            You pray. But you
            tremble when you hear the shouts of the demolition crews approaching. You cry out for
            mercy. You look into the eyes of your crucified King.</p>

        <p>Looking into his eyes, you feel his gaze into your soul. You do not understand. Why the
            love
            for you, but a poor man? Why the energy from the Cross to convince you: you are loved?
            Why the persisting message like a mantra in the sign of the Cross: <i>"I have come to
                bring life,
                and bring life to the full,"</i> <a href="#ref-5">v</a> and, <i>"Blessed are you who
                are poor.... Blessed are you who
                hunger now... Blessed are you when men hate you..."</i> <a href="#ref-6">vi</a></p>

        <p>Why his silent acceptance of abuse, hatred, rejection, oppression and death in rejection
            of
            yours? Why his abiding identification with you, as he calls on his disciples to act in
            your aid?
            <i>"Whatever you do for this poor person, that you do for me. ... Whatever you do not do
                for this
                poor person, that you do not do for me?"</i> <a href="#ref-7">vii</a> Why, on your
            behalf, to any who follow him, his
            mandate to works of mercy? "Feed the hungry. Give drink to the thirsty. Clothe the
            naked.
            Shelter the homeless. Visit the sick. Ransom the captive. Bury the dead." <a
                    href="#ref-8">viii</a> For the answers
            to these questions... look into his eyes, and search within.</p>

        <h2>You who are weary...</h2>

        <p>In the Year of the Poor, all you who labor and are heavily burdened, we your Pastors
            invite
            you, as Jesus himself did: come to Jesus. <i>"Come to me,"</i> Jesus said, <i>"and I
                will give you
                rest.”</i> <a href="#ref-9">ix</a> Life has not reduced you to penury, but life has
            not lifted you to wealth. To you also
            Jesus has said, <i>"I have come to give life, and to give it to the full."</i></p>

        <p>Thinking of your families, your spouses, your children, the relatives who run to you for
            help
            in their unending need, you work long hours, you work overtime, you even take on second
            and third jobs, just to make ends meet. Often ends don't meet; demands exhaust you; your
            taskmasters overstress you; worries distress you.</p>

        <p>But you labor on in love. Thinking of the smiles on your children's faces and the
            promises
            you have made your spouse to provide adequately, you work on, hoping your sacrifice will
            bring the full life that Jesus brings. Whenever you can, whenever you remember, you
            pray.
            You ask him to help. You ask his mother for help. He does help. She does come to your
            aid.
            You know that. Now, coming to Jesus hanging from his Cross, look into his eyes as he
            looks
            into yours with love.</p>

        <h2>You who are rich...</h2>

        <p>“I have come to bring life,” he said, “life to the full.” Some of you, sadly, are unmoved
            by
            this. You do not believe this. You do not believe Jesus brings anything. You say you do,
            but
            you don't.</p>

        <p>For you, the fullness of life is the good life: your doing. It is not gifted, but taken.
            It is not
            brought to you as a blessing from above, but seized as a result of pushing and shoving
            from
            below. It is not selfless, but selfish. It is fueled by pride, scheming ambition, the
            exhilaration
            of power, the taste of blood. For this you work harder than hard, you push yourselves to
            the
            limit, you even push beyond the limit. To achieve “the sweet life,” to outdo your
            ambitions,
            to over satiate your sycophants, to make them applaud without end, you abuse your
            bodies,
            you break the law, you violate your conscience; you ravage Creation. Your social life is
            your
            needy ego. You manipulate people, exploit their skills; take advantage of their
            weaknesses;
            pay them poorly. What is rightly theirs, you steal; what rightly belongs to society, you
            conceal. What is there for all, you hoard for yourself. For you, there is no common
            good,
            only your good!</p>

        <p>You build your first house, then your second houses; you provide for your family, then
            for
            your second families. You fill your lives with deceit, hypocrisy, and misery, and so
            glory in
            your "good life.” You take great satisfaction in that you are not like the rest of the
            rabble.
            You have no need for prayer; you have no need for God.</p>

        <p>In this Year of the Poor, we your Pastors invite you, step back from the rat race, the
            pressure,
            the din. Step back, and look into the eyes of the King.</p>

        <p>His gaze penetrates through your eyes to your heart. It is the same gaze of compassion as
            his
            gaze into the eyes of the poor. But it is a gaze altered by your own arrogance and
            cynicism.
            It is a gaze marked by concern. You may not wish to hear his message, but he says it
            again
            for you: <i>"Woe to you who are rich, for you have received your consolation. Woe to you
                who
                are full now, for you will be hungry. Woe to you who laugh now, for you will mourn
                and
                weep. Woe when society speaks well of you, for your fathers did the same to false
                prophets."</i> <a href="#ref-10">x</a></p>

        <p>He doesn't thunder this from loudspeakers, nor embarrass you with this in the media, for
            you
            are well-respected and honorable persons. He says it simply in his gaze, knowing fully
            you
            can reject it, as you have rejected it before.</p>

        <p>But in the Year of the Poor, where so many poor are poor because of your decisions, he
            also
            reminds you that over concern with your humungous investments, your corporate takeovers,
            your capture of political power and your fine reputations to the detriment or negligence
            of the
            poor may have serious consequences. <i>"Whatever you have done or not done to one of
                these
                the least of my brothers and sisters, that you have done or not done to me."</i> For
            not feeding
            the hungry, clothing the naked, succoring the sick, sheltering the stranger, visiting
            the
            imprisoned, the Lord, the Just Judge, may say to you, <i>"Depart from me, you cursed,
                into the
                eternal fire..." for I was poor, and you did not care.</i></p>

        <p>If you have trouble believing this, look into his eyes gazing at you from the Cross.</p>

        <h2>Behold Jesus poor...</h2>

        <p>If that gaze, filled will love, brings you to confusion, shame and repentance <a
                href="#ref-11">xi</a> in this Year of
            the Poor, then consider its urgent challenge for you:</p>

        <p>With God's grace, turn away from your haughtiness, your pride, your selfishness, your
            idolatry of money, your all-consuming fascination with power. In love, work to build the
            Kingdom of God on earth! <a href="#ref-12">xii</a></p>

        <p>In the Philippines, this means, urgently: stop the corruption. </p>

        <p>Stop the misuse of the People's funds. Stop the wanton destruction of the environment.
            Fight
            the poverty of the poor. Build vibrant companies that use our resources to create wealth
            for
            our people, but distribute that wealth equitably. <a href="#ref-13">xiii</a> Build an
            economy that responds to the
            unconscionable poverty of the fishermen, the tillers of the soil, the urban laborers.
            Build an
            economy that is open to the world, but whose benefits do not exclude the poor. <a
                    href="#ref-14">xiv</a> Provide
            jobs.</p>

        <p>Provide education that respects all our people as human beings and children of God, not
            just
            cogs in a global production machine. But provide education relevant to the fight against
            dehumanizing poverty: basic education to all, and higher education to all who desire it.
            <a href="#ref-15">xv</a>
            Build a society of dialogue in our diversity, and especially for our poor, build a
            society of
            peace. <a href="#ref-16">xvi</a> No more war, for the greatest victims of war are the
            poor!</p>

        <h2>Behold Jesus, hope of the poor...</h2>

        <p>If that gaze, filled with love, brings you in poverty to consolation, encouragement and
            peace,
            take heart in Jesus' love. He strengthens you, encourages you, and calls the Christian
            community to help you progress from destitution to the fullness of life.</p>

        <p>But help the community in helping yourselves. Should you have no work, look for work.
            Should you have work, work well. Cultivate a personal sense of industry, self-respect
            and
            social responsibility. As the economy allows, continue to provide well for your family
            in
            love: nutritious food, adequate clothing, medical care, good education, wholesome
            recreation.
            Strive for conditions of work that are humane and just. Continue to contribute to the
            welfare
            of your neighbors, your barangay, your municipality, your city, your nation. Always be
            helpful. Vote as the common good demands. Together with your spouse, lead your children
            to the love and respect the Lord through our Catholic communion. Be active in your
            parish
            and in your basic ecclesiastical community. Love, as you are loved by God. Share
            courageously of your faith in love! You are not just receivers of the Gospel. You are
            its
            bearers! <a href="#ref-17">xvii</a></p>

        <h2>Shepherds looking into the eyes of the Good Shepherd...</h2>

        <p>Finally, in the year of the poor, we your pastors, and with us, all priests and
            religious, look
            with you into the eyes of the crucified Lord. How often it is that we have look into
            those
            tortured eyes and failed to notice their twinkle! We have seen only embarrassing defeat,
            jaded suffering and obvious dying, but failed to notice the light that pierces the gloom
            in our
            hearts. <a href="#ref-18">xviii</a></p>

        <p>In the void that loneliness and isolation brought by our distance from Crucified, we can
            be
            misled to fill the gaping abyss with new phones and ipads. We can cover the gaping
            vacuum
            with another luxury car or designer jeans or more fashionable shoes more than our shoe
            racks
            can contain; with a vacation out of the country or another gadget for the bedroom. We
            can
            hold on to the whisky bottle and hope that the bottled spirit will exorcise the spirit
            of boredom
            in us. It can also be filled up by working like a horse to impress the people, to create
            a fans’
            club and move you up higher to a better assignment. It can also increase our interest in
            bank
            savings, the stock market and the accumulation of more properties. Church funds and
            personal
            funds are deliberately mixed up. The parish crawls in financial difficulties while we
            sprint and
            jump with financial security. Our easy and comfortable lifestyles can make us numb to
            the
            peril of worldliness. It can make us at ease with ecclesiastical vanities.</p>

        <p>How often have we reduced his living eyes to painted plastic on a wall, and deprived
            ourselves of feeling what those eyes twinkling in passion convey: that we are noticed,
            appreciated, valued, and sent forth. In so doing, we have cheated ourselves of the only
            treasure in our calling: the felt certainty from the Cross that we are each individually
            and
            totally loved.</p>

        <p>We have exchanged this prize, this pearl of great price <a href="#ref-19">xix</a> , for
            the
            compulsive conservation of
            conceptual castles, for the anxious pettiness of rules and regulations, for the
            obsessive
            preservation of a pecking order, for the selfish defense of private space, for the
            eccentric
            collection of quaint things, as well as for the lifelong preparation for our retirement.

        <p>Or, we have exchanged this self-emptied Messiah for self-established messiahs on
            distinguished thrones, ourselves rejecting the folly of the Cross, preferring the
            authority of
            feared prelates or the renown of pious celebrity or the fashionable cynicism of the
            insecure.
            For these recognized spiritual professionals, there is really no need for prayer, no
            need for
            prophets, and certainly no need for the unlettered and unwashed, for all ultimately is
            about
            themselves. <a href="#ref-21">xxi</a></p>

        <h2>Look at Jesus...</h2>

        <p>In this year of the poor, we too are being asked in silence to peer into the eyes of the
            crucified
            Lord, not plastic, nor wooden, nor closed, but open for me, confusing me, disturbing me,
            returning me to an original inspiration, healing me, raising me up, making me whole and
            surprising me anew with unaccustomed joy. In those twinkling eyes, we consider the quiet
            invitation to be actually poor, one with him, stripped of his clothes, his dignity, his
            possessions, his power, his strength, one with the unwashed, the oppressed, the scorned,
            the
            powerless, the miserable, the outcaste. Of course, we can say <i>no</i>. We can repeat
            the valid,
            reasonable excuses. But we can also say <i>yes</i>.</p>

        <p>In this Year of the Poor, may our neediness be turned to sanctity, and may our arrogance
            be
            turned to service. <a href="#ref-22">xxii</a> In all, may the love of the Crucified Lord
            triumph as he gazes into our
            hearts and we dare to look into his.</p>

        <p>Amen. Amen.</p>

            agents of evangelization. “The ‘Church of
            the Poor’ will also mean that the Church will not only evangelize the poor, but that the
            poor in the
            Church will themselves become evangelizers. Pastors and leaders will learn to be with
            work with
            and learn from the poor. A ‘Church of the Poor will not only render preferential service
            to the poor
            but will practice preferential reliance on the poor in the work of evangelization” (PCP
            II, 132)</p>

        <p><span id="ref-18">xviii</span> In Evangelii Gaudium, 1-3, Pope Francis invites all to
            return to the joy of the Gospel, to "embark
            upon a new chapter of evangelization marked by this joy" (EG, 1). Unto this end, he
            says, "I invite
            all Christians everywhere, at this very moment, to a renewed personal encounter with
            Jesus Christ,
            or at least to an openness to letting him encounter them" (EG, 3)</p>
